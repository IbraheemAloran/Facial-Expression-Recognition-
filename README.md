# Facial-Expression-Recognition-

The main goal is to develop a machine learning model to classify
images of faces into 1 of 7 categories; Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. We implemented
a simple CNN as our baseline model, and added several variations to it such
as different image preprocessing techniques, data augmentation, using techniques such as early
stopping, batch normalization and adding dropout layers to the fully connected layers of our CNN
to increase accuracy. We also researched and experiemnted with a pre-trained model, VGG16 , to extract features
from our dataset and then transferring those learnt features to our model as input to see if the
transfer learning method gave better results.
